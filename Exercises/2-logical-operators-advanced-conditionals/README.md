# Part II: Logical Operators & Advanced Conditionals

*Note: Before getting started on these exercises, please be certain that you've read through the root [README.md](../README.md) file in this repository.*

## Exercises

### Basic Requirements

#### Logical Operators

1. Is the `!` operator a *unary* operator, or *binary* operator?

2. Evaluate each of the following expressions first on a whiteboard, and then in
   a console:

   ```js
   !(2 >= 2)
   !(4 === 4)
   !(5 !== 5)
   ```

3. Evaluate each of the following expressions first on a whiteboard, and then in a
   console:

   ```js
   1 > 2 || 2 > 2 || 3 > 2
   5 < 5 || 75 < 74
   ```

#### Conditionals: `else if` & `else`

1. This guy named "Joe" keeps blacking out at the bar that your function,
   `bouncer` (from the previous module), is in charge of; thus, management has
   decided to add him to the "blacklist" -- modify the `bouncer` function from
   the previous section so that the person named "Joe" is rejected with an
   appropriate message, regardless of his age.

2. Write a function called `scoreToGrade` that accepts a *number* as a parameter
   and returns a *string* representing a letter grade corresponding to that
   score.

   For example, the following grades should be returned given these scores:

   + 'A' >= 90
   + 'B' >= 80
   + 'C' >= 70
   + 'D' >= 60
   + 'F' < 60

   ```js
   function scoreToGrade(score) {
     // TODO: your code here
   }
   scoreToGrade(95); // => 'A'
   scoreToGrade(72); // => 'C'
   ```

3. Modify the `scoreToGrade` function so that it returns `'INVALID SCORE'` if
   the score is greater than `100` or less than `0`.

### More Practice

1. Think of at least three activities that you enjoy doing outdoors and the
   range of temperatures and weather patterns (*e.g* sunny, windy, snowy, rainy,
   etc.) that are best for these activities. Write a function `whatToDoOutside`
   that accepts a *temperature* and *condition* as parameters and outputs a
   string of the format: "The weather is ideal for: ACTIVITY" (where ACTIVITY is
   an actual activity). Make sure to include an `else` that indicates what
   should be done if the conditions do not match any activities. If you're short
   on inspiration, here are some ideas:

   + **Snow Sports:** snowboarding, skiing
   + **Water Sports:** surfing, sailing, paddle boarding, swimming
   + **Team Sports:** basketball, baseball, football (American or everywhere
     else), etc.

2. The `guessMyNumber` function from the **Booleans & Conditionals** module
   (**More Practice** section) accepts a guess `n` and checks it against a
   random number from `0` to `5` -- if the guess `n` is greater than `5`, output
   a different message indicating that the guess is out of bounds.

   - **NOTE:** It will be helpful to *first* write a `randInt` function that
     accepts a number `n` and computes a random integer from `0` to `n`; then,
     you can use this function in `guessMyNumber`.

3. Modify the `scoreToGrade` function so that it returns `'A+/A-'` for
   scores of 98-100/90-92 respectively. Apply the same logic for all other
   letter grades.

### Advanced

1. The bar that employs our `bouncer` function has decided to do live music on
   Friday and Saturday nights, and will be admitting those that are over 18 to
   the bar on those nights; the catch however, is that all who are 21 or older
   will need to be given a wristband to distinguish them from the minors. Modify
   your `bouncer` function to handle this situation.

2. You should have noticed a large amount of repetitive code when modifying
   `scoreToGrade` to accommodate `+` or `-` grades. When we do lots of repetitive
   things, that's a clear signal that there's a better way. Write a helper function
   `letterGrade` that accepts two arguments, *letter* and *score*, and works as
   follows:

   ```js
   function letterGrade(letter, score) {
     // your code here
   }
   // These are examples of what a *working* function would output.
   letterGrade('A', 95); // => 'A'
   letterGrade('A', 91); // => 'A-'
   letterGrade('B', 88); // => 'B+'
   letterGrade('monkey', 160); // => 'monkey-'
   ```

   Finally, use `letterGrade` to remove the repetition in `scoreToGrade`.

3. It turns out that we can write logical *and* and logical *or* in terms of each
   other and logical *not* using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws" target="_blank">De Morgan's Laws</a>.

     + Write a function `or` that works like `||`, but only uses `!` and `&&`.
     + Write a function `and` that works like `&&`, but only uses `!` and `||`.
